review Long Class:
The class location is slightly wrong (should delete the "ganttproject" in the start). Other than that the explanation is good and so is the refactoring proposal.

review code smell Too Many Comments: Wrong class location.

(21/10/2022) Pedro Fernandes(60694):
review Long Method:
the class location indicates a duplicated directory (ganttproject) and is split into two lines. Besides that, the explained code seems to be a very clear anti-pattern, and the refactoring proposal sounds great.
