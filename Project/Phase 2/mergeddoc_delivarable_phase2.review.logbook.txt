Use Case Reviews

Guilherme Fernandes:
	(2/12/22) Pedro Lopes (57514):
	According to the user stories, it seems you mistyped Pert Chart, 
	besides that everything looks good.

Pedro Fernandes:
	(2/12/2022) Rafael Pereira(60700):
	Breaking the Use Case into several Use Case Diagrams was good, 
	as it made them easier to understand and read.
	Maybe change the name of the Diagram within the file, 
	they still have the default name "UseCaseDiagram1". Other than 
	that, I have nothing else to say everything seems to be fine.

	The diagram looks good, but Input Resource Data is acted on by the User,
	so maybe there should be a link between them.

Rafael Martins:
	(02/12/2022) Guilherme Fernandes:
	Nothing to say

Rafael Pereira:
	(30/11/2022) Rafael Martins(60602):
	It was a good idea to split the Use Case into 5 so it becomes simpler to understand it. 
	The 'SaveProject' Use Case has the wrong subject name inside it 
	(it says 'Import Project' instead of 'Save Project') but other than that everything seems good.


Metric Sets Reviews

Guilherme Fernandes:
	(2/12/2022) Pedro Lopes (57514):
	I think the linearly independent paths mentioned could be explained so 
	that the meaning cyclomatic complexity would be more clear to whoever is reading, 
	besides that i think the values are very well explained and the solutions 
	presented are valid. 

Pedro Fernandes:
	(04/12/2022) Rafael Pereira (60700):
	In the "potential trouble spots" there are a few points that could perhaps be deepened, 
	but other than that everything seems to be fine.

Pedro Lopes:
	(30/11/2022) Rafael Martins (60602):
	Each factor of the metric set is very well explained, 
	making it easy to understand and analyze the values even for someone that didn't 
	know what this metric set is related to.
	The trouble spots are also well identified and explained.
	I would add the name of the metric set to the start of the document just to be 
	more easily identifiable, everything else looks good.

Rafael Martins:
	(04/12/2022) Pedro Fernandes:
	The document has no graph of the metrics data.
	Besides that, the explanations provided and the data collected seems fine.

Rafael Pereira:
	(02/12/20022) Guilherme Fernandes:
	You need to add the graph with the metrics data.
	Even if the net.sourceforge.ganttproject.export.ConsoleUIFacade class is not complete,
	I think you could explain the current problem.
