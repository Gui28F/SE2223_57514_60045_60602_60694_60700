review Factory Pattern:
Class location is slightly incorrect (duplicated "ganttproject"). The explanation is good but I would change the part where it says "behind an interface" because this pattern is refering to a Class so it gets a bit confusing.

review Adapter Design Pattern: The explanation is a bit too simple.

Everything seems fine, the explanation and the code snippet reflect the indicated design pattern pretty well.
